# DHCP Server Configuration Script
This script is designed to automate the configuration of a DHCP server on Debian-based systems. The script prompts the user for necessary information such as network interfaces, subnet, netmask, router, DNS server, and IP address range to generate a DHCP server configuration file.

## Prerequisites
* Debian-based system
* Root privileges
## How to Use
* Clone or download the script to your Debian-based system.

* Run the following command to make the script executable:

```chmod +x RunMe.sh```
* Run the script with root privileges:


```sudo ./RunMe.sh```

Follow the prompts to configure your DHCP server.

* Select options from the main menu to install, activate or deactivate the DHCP server, enable IPv4 forwarding, disable iptables, configure DHCP server, or change the service interface.

* For DHCP server configuration, enter the necessary network information when prompted.

* Once you have completed the configuration, you will be asked whether to apply the configuration or not.

* Review the configuration generated by the script.

* If you choose to apply the configuration, the script will write the configuration to the DHCP server configuration file located at /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf.
### Restart the DHCP server:

```systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server```
